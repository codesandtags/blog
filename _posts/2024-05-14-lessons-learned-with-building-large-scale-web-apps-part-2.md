## Introduction

After reading the book [“Building large scale web apps”](https://largeapps.dev/) by [Addy Osmani](https://addyosmani.com/) and [Hassan Djirdeh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hassandjirdeh/?originalSubdomain=ca), I decided to write a post about the lessons learned with the book. The book is a great resource for developers who want to learn how to build large web applications. The authors cover a wide range of topics, from architecture to performance optimization, and provide practical advice on how to build scalable web applications.

This is the continuation of the first part of the post, where I covered the first 5 chapters of the book. In this post, I will cover the next 5 chapters of the book, which focus on internationalization, A/B testing, scalable web architecture, testing, and tooling.

## Internationalization

Internationalization is the process of adapting a web application to support multiple languages and regions. By optimizing the internationalization process, developers can reach a wider audience, improve the user experience, and increase user engagement. There are many factors that can affect the internationalization of a web application, such as the size of the translation files, the number of supported languages, and the complexity of the translation process.

## A/B Testing

A/B testing is a technique that compares two versions of a web application to determine which one performs better. By optimizing the A/B testing process, developers can identify the most effective design, content, and functionality for a web application, and improve the overall user experience. There are many factors that can affect the A/B testing process, such as the size of the test group, the duration of the test, and the metrics used to measure success.

## Scalable Web Architecture

## Testing

Testing developers to identify and fix bugs, improve the quality of the codebase, and increase the reliability of a web application. By optimizing the testing process, developers can reduce the risk of introducing bugs, improve the user experience, and increase the scalability of the application. There are many types of testing available for web applications, such as unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing.

## Tooling

Tooling enables developers to automate repetitive tasks, improve the quality of the codebase, and increase the productivity of the team. By optimizing the tooling process, developers can reduce the time spent on manual tasks, improve the consistency of the codebase, and increase the scalability of the application. There are many tools available for web development, such as linters, formatters, and bundlers.

## Conclusions

## Quotes

- "“The best solutions are simple but not simplistic.”
- "There is an essential complexity to all meaningful software. We can never eliminate that complexity; we can only control it.” Grady Booch
- "The secret to building large apps is never to build large apps. Break your applications into small pieces. Then, assemble those testable, bite-sized pieces into your big application.” Justin Meyer
