## Introduction

I have been working as a software engineer for more than 10 years, and I have seen many people grow in their careers. Some of them have become Staff Engineers, and I have always been curious about how they did it. I have read many articles and books about this topic, and I want to share with you some of the lessons I have learned from the Staff Engineer path.

The book is divided in **3 sections (pillars)** and **9 chapters**, so I'll try to summarize the main points of each chapter based on this order.

Before to start we need to understand there are 2 paths to grow in your career when you are a software engineer:

- **The technical path**: It is for people who want to focus on technical skills and become experts in a specific area.
- **The management path**: It is for people who want to focus on leadership skills and manage teams.
