## Why use codesandbox ?

I think the world has evolved a lot since we have the option to run containers on the browser and docker existed. I remember the first time I used `codesandbox` was to run a `React` project, and I was amazed by the simplicity and the speed to run the project.

In this post I will show you how to use `codesandbox` to run a simple `React` project and how to share it with your friends or team, for instance in this article.

### Create a new project

First, go to the [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) website and click on the `Create Sandbox` button.

After that, you will see a list of templates to start your project. In this case, I will choose the `React` template.

### Run the project

Once you have selected the template, you will see the `React` project running on the browser. You can see the `src` folder, the `public` folder, and the `package.json` file.

### Share the project

To share the project, you can click on the `Share` button, and you will see a modal with the link to share the project.

If you share your project in your repository, you can also click on the `Embed` button and copy the code to paste it in your `README.md` file.

### Voil√†

     style="width:100%; height: 500px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;"
     title="cards"
     allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking"
     sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
   ></iframe>

### Conclusion

I think `codesandbox` is a great tool to run and share your projects with your friends or team. It's simple, fast, and you don't need to install anything on your machine. Give it a try and let me know your thoughts.
