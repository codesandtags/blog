## Introduction

Today I woke up and I realized that I have been working in the software industry for more than 10 years (To be more exact ðŸ‘´ 14 years now). I have seen many people grow in their careers, and I have always been curious about how they did it, everyone has a story to tell. I have read many articles and books about this topic, I have worked in different industries, and changed the career path a few times, so finally I want to share with you some of the lessons I have learned from my career.

## The beginning

### Software Test Engineer: The old good 2000`s

Since I started my career I wanted to write code (I've always consider myself as a self-taught person), however for someone without experience nor a degree in computer science, it was hard to get a job as a software engineer in `2006`. I started as a Software Test Engineer for a `Company of Financial Services`, making sure the `Cobol` applications were working as expected, while I was working to `type faster`, learning `DOS commands`, reading books about `C++` and `Java`, understanding how the slow `Internet` worked, meeting people with random `nicknames` in a `IRC with proud hackers`, and trying to understand the `Linux` world, and playing with `JavaScript`, `CSS`, and `HTML`.

At that time knowing how to code in `Java` and `PHP` was a trending topic in the world, we didn't have the clear concept of `Frontend` and `Backend`, we were just `developers` or `programmers`, probably life was simpler back then.

After that I grew up becoming as a `Semi Senior Test Engineer` in a `Payments industry`, working with `Java`, `Maven` and moving to the `web world`, playing with `Selenium` to automate some flows, `Jmeter` to test the performance of the applications, and `Mantis` to report the bugs. I still had my desire to move to the `development world`, so I got the `Java Programmer` certification and a few months later I got my first job as a `Software Development Engineer`.

### Software Development Engineer: The new era

After getting my first job as a `Software Development Engineer` in a `Ads and Marketing industry` related to `real-state`, I learned about many ways to the job working in a dynamic team and a fast pace way. I ended-up working late many times, refactoring code, reading other's code, learning from mistakes like going to production without testing, fixing things on production, having scripts to fix things directly in the database. Probably at that time the things were not as organized as they are now, and I thought the `Agile` methodology was a joke.

Moving forward I found new opportunities on the road, I started working as a `Semi Senior Developer` in a `Health Care` industry. This time the things were better, working with talented people, learning about `Design Patterns`, many JavaScript concepts and understanding how `jQuery` worked. I was amazed to work with such a talented team, that I felt the first time about the `Impostor Syndrome`.

Quickly I learned about new ways to deliver code, to have a proper testing review, agile stories described using `BDD`, versioning, changelogs and for the first time I was working as a proper `Full Stack Developer` creating full end-to-end features, however I had the feeling that I was missing something, and it was the opportunity to work in another region of the world.

### Leveling Up the career with English

In `2014` I realized the only way to grow in my career was to learn `English`, so I started learning by myself with `Youtube videos`, practicing `Duolingo`, reading `books` in English, and watching movies and `tutorials` with subtitles, just to accelerate the learning process. After that I started taking `Interviews` in English with the shame of not knowing how to speak properly, and sometimes I felt frustrated about my bad pronunciation. After a few months of consistency I got my first job as a `Senior Software Engineer` in a company with presence in the `Digital Agency World`.

At this company everything was different, the people were more talented, the projects were more complex, the clients were more demanding, the challenges were bigger and the salary higher. I had to speak often in `English` to give my status in the `daily meetings`, present the `demo` to the clients in the end of each `sprint`, I was working closely with the `Product Owners`, `Software Architects`, `QA Engineers`, and a lot of talented people in some internal communities, and to sum up, I was mentoring some `Junior Developers` and `Interns`.

When I had the opportunity I moved from the `Back End Role` to the `Front End Role` which I enjoyed more, mainly because I loved to see the interaction on every web application and feel how my work contributed to an amazing `user experience` to the clients, and at the same time I was creating something beautiful and useful on top of technologies such as `Nodejs`, `Express.js`, `Backbone.js`, `MVC patterns`, `bundlers`, `pre-processors` and different levels of `testing`.

### Don't settle, be bold

After almost two years of working, learning, growing, and sharing my knowledge, I realized the my it was time to keep moving forward in the `Career path` and take new challenges, so I moved to another company as a `Software Developer` in a similar industry, but shortly I got a better and unique opportunity to work as a `Full Stack Specialist` in an almost `green field project` for a company that was just acquired by a big company in the `Financial` industry.

Working for a bank at first glance seemed strange, but it was not just a bank, it was a `startup` inside a bank, and the project was to create a `Digital Experience` from scratch, so I was part of the `Core Team` that was responsible to create the `Front End` and `Back End` of the `Digital Experience` for customers. I was working with the `Product Owners`, `Software Architects`, `QA Engineers`, `DevOps Engineers`, `Security Engineers`, working with global teams, coordinating with the `UX Designers`, `Business Analysts`, `Project Managers`, and `Stakeholders`.

At this time working in a `product based project` I learned many things related to Product Experience, User Experience, Design Systems, Docker, Security, Processes, Compliance, Monitoring, KPIs, OKRs, Agile Teams and how to work in a `cross functional team`, working in a defined domains, creating `Microservices` architecture that could be used by many applications, and later on creating `Micro Frontends` that could be used by many teams. It was a great experience to work in a `Digital Transformation` project, and I felt that I was part of something big, I was part of a community leading the `Front End` part with `Angular` and other technologies such as `Nodejs`, `TypeScript`, `Reactjs`.

Time flights when you are having fun, and after a few years working in this project, I was promoted to `Senior Advanced Software Developer`, and then to `Software Architect`, I think I was living one of my dreams and greatest goals in my career, and I was proud of myself, but I knew that I was missing something, and it was the opportunity to work in another region of the world.

### Moving to another country and starting again

During `COVID` time when the world was locked down, I got an opportunity in the same company to work in `Canada`, at that time I had another offer from a `Germany` company with a bigger role, however, I thought that working in an English speaking country would be better for me, the only downside was that I had to start again from the `Software Developer` role, but I thought it was a good opportunity to learn new things, meet new people, and grow in my career.

In `February 2021`, I finally moved to Canada working as a `Software Developer`, I contributed to `Design System` and using my skills in `Front End`, `Back End`, `Architecture`, `negotiation` I had the challenge to run a `Global pilot project` to promote the `Software Reusability` in the company, and I was part of the `Global Team` working with people from different countries, and I was proud to be part of the `Global Community`.

In order to work in a `Global Team` I had to learn more about Time Zones, Cultural Differences, Communication, Remote Work, DevOps, KPIs, OKRs, prioritization, and how to lead by example, creating a `Community of Practice` to share knowledge, reading a lot of `InnerSource`, identifying pains or challenges from other teams/regions, and finally understanding more about the `Business` and the `Company Strategy`, reporting to `Managers`, `Directors` and `VPs`.

By time that I'm writing this article I'm working as a `Senior Software Engineer` in a `Global Team`, helping to improve the `Developer Experience`, promoting the `Software Reusability`, writing technical documentation and helping teams in some `Large, Distributed and Global projects`.

## Connecting the dots

In summary looking back and connecting the dots I have:

- Worked as a Tester Functional Engineer, Automation Tester, Back End Developer, Front End Developer, Full Stack Developer, Tech Lead, Software Architect, junior many times in some fields, but also mentor of many people.
- Been in different industries such as `Financial`, `Payments`, `Ads and Marketing`, `Health Care`, `Digital Agency`, `Financial`, `Bank`, `Digital Transformation`, `Global Team`.
- Learned there are some pillars, fundamentals and principles that don't change very often, while some technologies, frameworks, libraries and tools change every week and use different names.
- Failed many times, but I learned from my mistakes, and I tried to improve myself every day.

Right now I'm learning about how to become a `Staff Software Engineer`, and I'm pretty sure the dots will connect in the future, and I will be able to share more lessons learned from this path, however, after connecting the dots I also realized that I have some regrets that probably could have changed my career path, and I want to share with you some of them.

### My regrets

- I wish I had started to `write code` earlier.
- I wish I had finished many of my `side projects` in my Github account.
- I wish I had learned `Data Structures` and `Algorithms` earlier.
- I wish I had learned about `Design Patterns` earlier.
- I wish I had kept writing articles and sharing my knowledge with the world.
- I wish I had started to learn `English` earlier.
- I wish I had started to learn about `Docker` and `Kubernetes` earlier.
- I wish I had learned how to `manage my time` and speak in `public` earlier.
- I wish I had learned how to `negotiate` and `lead` earlier.
- I wish I had learned about `Cloud Computing` earlier.
- I wish I had mentored more people and learned from them.
- I wish I had given more `talks` and `workshops` in `conferences`.
- I wish I had documented more about my `career path` and `lessons learned`.

I know that I cannot change the past, because that past made me who I am today, however, after connecting the dots I can influence the `future` and `change` the `present`, so I will keep learning, growing, sharing, and connecting the dots to become a better person, a better professional, and a better leader.
