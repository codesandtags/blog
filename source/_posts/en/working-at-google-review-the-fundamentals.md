Reviewing the fundamentals is crucial for preparing for Google software interviews, as they form the foundation of your problem-solving skills. Here are the key areas you should focus on when reviewing computer science fundamentals:

## Data structures:

Ensure you have a solid understanding of basic data structures and their operations, including:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists (singly and doubly)
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees (binary, balanced, AVL, red-black)
- Graphs (directed, undirected, adjacency matrix, adjacency list)
- Heaps (min and max)
- Hash Tables (hash functions, collision resolution techniques)

## Algorithms:

Familiarize yourself with common algorithms, their use cases, and how to implement them:

- Searching (linear, binary)
- Sorting (bubble, insertion, selection, merge, quick, radix)
- Recursion and backtracking (e.g., permutations, combinations, tree traversal)
- Dynamic programming (e.g., memoization, top-down, bottom-up)
- Graph traversal (depth-first search, breadth-first search, Dijkstra's, A\*, Bellman-Ford)
- Greedy algorithms (e.g., Kruskal's, Prim's, Huffman coding)

## Complexity analysis:

Develop a strong understanding of time and space complexity, including:

- Big-O, Big-Ω, and Big-Θ notation
- How to analyze the time and space complexity of an algorithm
- Understanding the complexity of common operations on various data structures
- Identifying and optimizing bottlenecks in your code

## Programming languages:

Be proficient in at least one programming language, preferably one that is commonly used at Google, such as Python, Java, Typescript, or C++. You should be comfortable with the syntax, standard libraries, and language-specific data structures and algorithms.

## Object-oriented programming (OOP):

Understand OOP concepts, such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction. Be able to design and implement classes, interfaces, and objects in your chosen programming language.

## Operating systems and concurrency:

Familiarize yourself with basic operating system concepts, such as process management, memory management, file systems, and synchronization primitives (e.g., mutexes, semaphores, locks).

## Networking:

Acquire a basic understanding of networking concepts, such as the OSI model, TCP/IP, sockets, and common network protocols (HTTP, FTP, DNS, etc.).

## Databases:

Learn about relational databases (e.g., SQL, normalization, indexing) and NoSQL databases (e.g., key-value stores, document databases, column stores, graph databases).
By reviewing these fundamentals and practicing problems that involve their application, you'll be better equipped to tackle Google's software interview questions and demonstrate your problem-solving skills.
