## Chapter 9: Architecture Styles

1. **List the eight fallacies of distributed computing.**

- Falacy #1: The network is reliable.
- Falacy #2: Latency is zero.
- Falacy #3: Bandwidth is infinite.
- Falacy #4: The network is secure.
- Falacy #5: Topology doesn't change.
- Falacy #6: There is only one administrator.
- Falacy #7: Transport cost is zero.
- Falacy #8: The network is homogeneous.

1. **Name three challenges that distributed architectures have that monolithic architectures donâ€™t.**

- Distributed logging
- Distributed transactions
- Contract maintenance and versioning

2. **What is stamp coupling?**

ðŸ¤“ Stamp coupling occurs when modules share a composite data structure and use only parts of it, possibly different parts (e.g., passing a whole record to a function that needs only one field of it).

3. **What are some ways of addressing stamp coupling?**

- Create private RESTful API endpoints
- Use field selectors in the contract
- Use GraphQL to decouple contracts
- Use value-driven contracts with consumer-driven contracts (CDCs)
- Use internal messaging endpoints
