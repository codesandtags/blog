### Summary

This book is a great introduction to software architecture, it covers the basics of software architecture, and it's a great starting point for anyone who wants to learn more about software architecture. This part is focused on techniques and soft skills by software architects.

## Chapter 19: Architecture Decisions

**1. What is the covering your assets anti-pattern?**

The covering your assets anti-pattern is when you make a decision based on the fear of being blamed for something that goes wrong. This is a common anti-pattern in software architecture, and it can lead to poor decisions.

**2. What are some techniques for avoiding the email-driven architecture anti-pattern?**

The first rule of communicationg architecture decisions is not to include the architecture decisions in the body of an email. This is a common anti-pattern in software architecture, and it can lead to poor decisions. A better approach is to mention only the nature and context of the decision the body of the email, and then attach the architecture decision record (ADR) as an attachment.

The second rule of effectively communicating architecture decisions is to only notifiy those people who really care about the architecture decision.

**3. What are the five factors Michael Nygard defines for identifying something as architecturally significant?**

According to Michal Nygard, architecturally significan deecisions are those decisions that affect the structure, non-functional characteristics, dependencies, interfaces, and construction techniques of a system.

**4. What are the five basic sections of an architecture decision record?**

The five basic sections of an architecture decision record are:

- **Title**: The title of the ADR.
- **Status**: The status of the ADR.
- **Context**: The context of the ADR.
- **Decision**: The decision of the ADR.
- **Consequences**: The consequences of the ADR.

**5. In which section of an ADR do you typically add the justification for an architecture decision?**

In the **Decision** section of an ADR you typically add the justification for an architecture decision.

**6. Assuming you don't need a separate Alternatives section, in which section of an ADR would you list the alternatives to your proposed solution?**

In the **Consequences** section of an ADR you would list the alternatives to your proposed solution.

**7. What are the trhee basic criteria in which you would mark the status of an ADD proposed?**

The three basic criteria in which you would mark the status of an ADD proposed are:

- **Proposed**: The proposed solution has been proposed by the team.
- **Accepted**: The proposed solution has been accepted by the team.
- **Superseded**: The proposed solution has been superseded by another solution.

## Chapter 20: Analyzing Architecture Risk

**1. What are the two dimensions of the risk assessment matrix?**

The two dimensions of the risk assessment matrix are:

- **Likelihood of risk occurring**: The probability of the risk occurring.
- **Overall impact of risk**: The impact of the risk occurring.

**2. What are some ways to show direction of a particular risk within a risk assessment? Can you think of other ways to indicate wheter risk is getting better or worse?**

Some ways to show direction of a particular risk within a risk assessment are:

- **Color**: Using color to indicate whether risk is getting better or worse.
- **Arrows**: Using arrows to indicate whether risk is getting better or worse.
- **Signs plus or minus**: Using signs plus or minus to indicate whether risk is getting better or worse.
- **A combination of both**: Using a combination of both to indicate whether risk is getting better or worse, to make it simpler to understand.

**3. Why is it necessary for risk storming to be a collaborative exercise?**

Because all architects have a differente knowledge of the architecture, and points of view about the risk for each area to be analyzed.

**4. Why is it necessary for the identification activity whithin risk storming to be an individual activity and not a collaborative one?**

Because it is important to get the individual perspective of each participant, and not the group perspective. It's also important to restrict risk storming efforts to a single dimension.

**5. What would you do if three participants identified risk as high (6) for a particular area of the architecture, but another participant identified it as only medium (3)?**

When this situation happens, it's important to discuss the risk with the participants, and try to reach a consensus. At the end the idea is to have an agreement on the risk level for each area of the architecture.

**6. What risk rating (1-9) would you assign to unproven or unkown technologies?**

For unproven or unkonwn technologies, I would assign a risk rating of 9, since the matrix cannot be used for this dimension.
