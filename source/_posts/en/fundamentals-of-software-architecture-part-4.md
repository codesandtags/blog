## Chapter 13: Service-Based Architecture

<img src="images/books/software-service-based-architecture-rating.png" alt="Service Based Architecture Rating" width="60%"/>

**1. How many services are there in a typical service-based architecture?**

ðŸ¤“ The number of services within an application context generally range between 4 and 12 services, with the average being about 7 services.

**2. Do you have to break apart a database in service-based architecture?**

ðŸ¤“ No, it's not mandatory to break apart a database in service-based architecture. However, it's often recommended to have a database per service to achieve data encapsulation and maintain bounded contexts. In these cases it is important to make sure the data in each separate database is not needed by another domain service

**3. Under what circumstances might you want to break apart a database?**

ðŸ¤“ You might want to break apart a database when:

- Services require independent scaling.
- Different services have different data storage requirements.
- You want to ensure loose coupling and high cohesion.
- There are concerns about data integrity or security that can be mitigated by separating data.

**4. What technique can you use to manage database changes within a service-based architecture?**

ðŸ¤“ One way to mitigate the impact and risk of database changes is to logically partition the database and manifest the logical partitioning through federated shared libraries.

**5. Do domain services require a container (such as Docker) to run?**

ðŸ¤“ No, domain services don't inherently require a container. However, using containers like Docker can provide benefits in terms of isolation, repeatability, and scalability.

**6. Which architecture characteristics are well supported by the service-based architecture style?**

ðŸ¤“ The service-based architecture style supports well characteristics like :

- Deployability
- Modularity
- Fault Tolerance
- Overall Cost
- Reliability
- Testability

**7. Why isnâ€™t elasticity well supported in a service-based architecture?**

ðŸ¤“ Although programmatic scalability and elasticity are certainly possible with this architecture style, more functionality is replicated than with finer-grained services (such as microservices) and as such is not as efficient in terms of machine resources and not as cost-effective. Additionally, if services share resources like databases, it might be harder to scale them independently.

**8. How can you increase the number of architecture quanta in a service-based architecture?**

ðŸ¤“ You can increase the number of architecture quanta by decomposing larger services into smaller, more granular ones, ensuring each service encapsulates a specific piece of functionality or domain.

## Chapter 14: Event-Driven Architecture Style

<img src="images/books/software-event-driven-architecture-rating.png" alt="Event Driven Architecture Rating" width="60%"/>

**1. What are the primary differences between the broker and mediator topologies?**

<img src="images/books/software-tradeoffs-broker-topology.png" alt="Broker Topology Tradeoff" width="60%"/>

- In the **broker topology**, event producers and consumers are directly connected through an event channel, such as a message queue or a topic. The event channel is responsible for routing and delivering events to the consumers, without any central coordination or orchestration. The producers and consumers are loosely coupled and unaware of each other. It uses events.

<img src="images/books/software-tradeoffs-mediator-topology.png" alt="Mediator Topology" width="60%"/>

- In the **mediator topology**, event producers and consumers are indirectly connected through a central mediator, such as an event processor or a stream processor. The mediator is responsible for orchestrating and coordinating the events and the consumers, according to some predefined logic or rules. The producers and consumers are still loosely coupled, but they depend on the mediator for event processing. It uses commands.

**2. For better workflow control, would you use the mediator or broker topology?**

ðŸ¤“ I would use the mediator topology. The mediator topology allows me to define complex event processing logic, such as filtering, aggregating, transforming, or correlating events, and execute different actions based on the event data and context. The mediator topology also enables me to monitor and manage the event flow and handle errors or exceptions.

**3. Does the broker topology usually leverage a publish-and-subscribe model with topics or a point-to-point model with queues?**

ðŸ¤“ The broker topology usually leverages a publish-and-subscribe model with topics. A topic is a logical channel that can have multiple subscribers who receive all the events published to that topic. A topic can also have multiple partitions to increase scalability and performance. A publish-and-subscribe model with topics allows me to broadcast events to multiple consumers without knowing who they are or how many there are.

**4. Name two primary advantage of asynchronous communications.**

ðŸ¤“ Improved **performance and responsiveness**: Asynchronous communications allow the event producers to send events without waiting for a response from the event consumers, which reduces latency and improves throughput. Asynchronous communications also enable the event consumers to react to events as they occur, which increases responsiveness and user satisfaction.

**5. Give an example of a typical request within the request-based model.**

ðŸ¤“ A user submits an online order form on a website. The website sends a synchronous HTTP request to an order service that validates the order details, calculates the total price, and returns a confirmation message to the website. The website displays the confirmation message to the user.

**6. Give an example of a typical request in an event-based model.**

ðŸ¤“ A user submits an online order form on a website. The website publishes an OrderPlaced event to a message broker. An order service subscribes to the OrderPlaced event and receives a copy of it. The order service validates the order details, calculates the total price, and publishes an OrderConfirmed event to the message broker. A notification service subscribes to the OrderConfirmed event and receives a copy of it. The notification service sends an email confirmation to the user.

**7. What is the difference between an initiating event and a processing event in event-driven architecture?**

ðŸ¤“ An **initiating event** is an event that triggers a new business process or workflow. It usually originates from an external source, such as a user action or a sensor input. For example, an OrderPlaced event is an initiating event that starts an order processing workflow.

A **processing event** is an event that occurs as part of an existing business process or workflow. It usually originates from an internal source, such as another service or component. For example, an OrderConfirmed event is a processing event that continues an order processing workflow.

**8. What are some of the techniques for preventing data loss when sending and receiving messages from a queue?**

- **Synchronouse send**: Using durable queues that persist messages until they are consumed or expired.
- **Client Acknowledge mode**: Using acknowledgements that confirm when a message is successfully received or processed by a consumer.
- **Last Participant Support**: Using transactions that ensure atomicity and consistency of message operations.
- Using retries and dead-letter queues that handle failed or poisoned messages.

**9 What are three main driving architecture characteristics for using event-driven architecture?**

<img src="images/books/software-tradeoffs-event-driven-architecture.png" alt="Event Driven Architecture Tradeoffs" width="60%"/>

- **Real-time processing**: Event-driven architecture enables near real-time processing of events as they occur, which supports scenarios such as IoT, streaming analytics, fraud detection, etc.
- **Loose coupling**: Event-driven architecture enables loose coupling between event producers and consumers, which supports scenarios such as microservices, cloud-native applications, integration platforms, etc.
- **High scalability**: Event-driven architecture enables high scalability of event producers and consumers, which supports scenarios such as big data, social media, e-commerce, etc.

**10. What are some of the architecture characteristics that are not well supported in event-driven architecture?**

- Simplicity
- Testability
- Overall cost
- Deployability

Other characteristics to consider are:

- **Synchronous communication**: Event-driven architecture relies on asynchronous communication between event producers and consumers, which does not support scenarios that require immediate feedback or confirmation from another service or component.
- **Complex transactions**: Event-driven architecture does not support complex transactions that span multiple services or components, which require coordination, consistency, and rollback mechanisms.
- **Querying data**: Event-driven architecture does not support querying data across multiple services or components, which require aggregation, joining, filtering, and sorting mechanisms.
