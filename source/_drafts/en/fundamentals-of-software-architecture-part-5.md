## Fundamentals of Software Architecture

### Book Details

- **Title**: [Fundamentals of Software Architecture](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/fundamentals-of-software/9781492043447/)
- **Author**: Mark Richards, Neal Ford
- **Publication Year**: 2020

### Summary

This book is a great introduction to software architecture, it covers the basics of software architecture, and it's a great starting point for anyone who wants to learn more about software architecture. Here are some of the topics covered in this book and I want to answer the self-assessment questions for each chapter.
