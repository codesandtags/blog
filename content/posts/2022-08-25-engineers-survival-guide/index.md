## Context

This week I've recieved the book [Engineers Survival Guide](https://www.amazon.com/Engineers-Survival-Guide-Facebook-Microsoft-ebook/dp/B09MPKLMSH) by [Merih Taze](https://www.linkedin.com/in/merihtaze/), after reviewing many comments from people who read the book, and, I wanted to take my own insights.

## Notes taken from Atomic Habits book

### Fist day at Work and Imposter Syndrome

- "At that moment, I met a new friend who has not left me alone to this day, I'm sure you have met this friend, many people know it as Imposter Syndrome".
- "If you are feeling the effects of imposter syndrome, you are not alone! everyone has their masks up trying to look like they know what they are doing. We were taught to be self-promoting and to keep up a good image. What suprised me the most was, that as soon as I shared the way I felt with my friends, most of them said that they feel exactly the same"
- "Be aware we all feel like imposters sometimes, and do not let it get to you. It has nothing to do with how good you are, youre level, experience or anything else".

### The importance of data to convince others

- Engineers are data-driven people. No one argues with data. When you have a great idea, that intuition comes from data. Believe it or not, the reason you think it is a good idea vs a poor one, it is because of your eperience and the data insights you have gained from it.
- This is where the conflict starts with people. They are not againts your idea, they just do not have enough data about it. The more data you can provide, the easier it will be for them to believe in it.
