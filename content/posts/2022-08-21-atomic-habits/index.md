## Context

If you haven't heard about [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits), in few words is one of the most famous books which talks about this subject. One week ago I bought the book looking for a different way to have better habits in my life and I've decided to highlight the best notes from the book (in my opinion).

## Notes taken from Atomic Habits book

### The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits

- "A Habit is a routine or behavior that is performed regularly, and, in many cases, automatically".
- "We all deal with setbacks but in the long run, the quality of our lives often depends on the quality of our habits. With the same habits, you'll end up with the same results. But with better habits, anything is possible".
- "To write a great book, you must first become the book". - Naval Ravikant
- "Improving by 1 percent isn't particularly notable - sometimes it isn't even noticeable, but it can be far more meaningful, specially in the long run".
- "Success is the product of daily habits, no once-in-a-lifetime transformations".
- "Habits are a double-edge sword. Bad habits can cut you down just as easily as good habits can build you up".
- "Cancer spends 80 percent of its life undetectable, then takes over the body in months. Bamboo can barely be seen for the first five years as it builds extensive root systems undergrownd, before exploding ninety fee into the air within six weeks".
- "Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results"
- "Problem #1: Winner and losers have the same goals".
- "Problem #2: Achieveing a goal is only a momentary change"
- "Problem #3: Goals restric your happiness"
- "Problem #4: Goals are at odds with long-term progress"
- "You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems"

### How your habits shape your identity and vice versa

- "Once your habits are established, they seem to stick around forever - especially the unwanted ones".
- "Changing our habits is challenging for two reasongs: (1) we try to change the wrong thing and (2) we try to change our habits in the wrong way".
- "When you have repeated a story to yourself for year, it is easy to slide into these mental grooves and accept them as a fact".
