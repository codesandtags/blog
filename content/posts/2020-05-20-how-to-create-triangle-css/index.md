excerpt: Do you know how to create a triangle in CSS without using images?, Well here is a short explanation

A couple of days before, I had to face this common challenge, however, there are many solutions (using images, using divs, and using pseudo-elements with and empty content). For me, the best solution was using pseudo-elements, so that here is my solution.

If you want to read more about this common pattern, please review [this article in CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/css-triangle/) (One of the best pages for CSS Content).

## Understanding ::before and ::after pseudo-elements in CSS

In few words a [pseudo-element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements) is : 

> A CSS pseudo-element is a keyword added to a selector that lets you style a specific part of the selected element(s). For example, ::first-line can be used to change the font of the first line of a paragraph. 


## Creating the triangle

After understanding the above concept, it means we can add some content, or create another element given a selector. 
In our case, if we define a `border-width` and we have an empty `content`, the border will start from the center of the element.

Then, pretty much we need to play with the `border-color`, `border-width` and the `position:absolute` to create our triangle. Below, you will find a couple of examples in my [codepen](https://codepen.io/codesandtags/embed/ExVGWvG?height=265&theme-id=dark&default-tab=result).

## What's the next?

Well, I think that's all using a short example. Given the above examples, you can add letters, transformations, animations, and whatever you can imagine, using the pseudo-elements.
