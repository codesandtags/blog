Recently I've started a huge personal challenge that I will describe with more details in the next months, 
however a really critical part of this challenge is, **How can I learn faster?**. Well, I've bought 
a really nice course in Udemy, [Learning to learn](https://www.udemy.com/course/learning-to-learn-efficient-learning-zero-to-mastery/) 
by [Andrei Neagoie](https://www.udemy.com/user/andrei-neagoie/) and these are my notes.

Also I want to mention that I love the productivity stuffs, and I admire people like 
[Bill Gates](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates), and [Tim Ferris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Ferriss). 

# The principles

1. The [method of Loci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci) about memory enhacement.  
    - https://deck.of.cards/
2. Learning vs Winning to the system, by Paul Grahan
    - http://paulgraham.com/lesson.html
3. What is success?. This is subjective meaning, however it can be achieved with the next characteristics.
    - Drive 
    - Persistence
    - Going a good learner 
4. The obstacle & The dip
    1. [Seth Godin](https://www.sethgodin.com/#books-courses-and-more)
    2. Sometimes we have to know when to turn around and pick the right path in order to use our resources efficiently.
5. Compound learning
    1. The principle behind is: You don’t have to dedicate many hours one day to learning something, you need instead to learning at least 20 - 30 minutes per day, everyday to compound the learning in your mind.
    2. Improve by 1% a day, and in 70 days you’re twice a good. - Alan Wiss P.h D
    3. https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/financial/compound-interest-calculator.php
    4. https://www.bankrate.com/calculators/savings/compound-savings-calculator-tool.aspx
6. Failures don’t count on you
    1. Every time you make a mistake, any time you fail you are learning, it gives you feedback on why you should do next time.
7. Choice vs Chore
    1. Chores are temporary and they won’t last long, but if you start to shift your focus and realize that learning is a choice you can not do anything today
8. It’s all in the frame.
    1. Not everything in life is objective, rather than is subjective and everything depends of perspective, so we can reframe that.
    2. Shift your focus, shift your perspective on you can control, instead of you can not control.
9. Pareto principle
    1. Also know as the 80/20 rule. The law of vital few.
    2. 80 percent of sales comes from 20 percent of clients.
    3. 80 percent of code comes from 20 percent of programmers.
    4. It’s about eliminating things.
    5. Composition by Pietro monad. $50 Million Dollars
    6. Is this the best use of my time?
10. Skill Staking
    - Mastering by [Robert Greene](https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Robert-Greene/dp/014312417X) says there are 3 keys. 
        1. Curiosity
        2. Value of learning
        3. Staking your skills in different unique ways.
    - For example, if you are a programmer and you combine your programming skills with business skills, or communication skills you will be more valuable.
    - It’s not about being the greatest in one thing, you just need to be pretty good at list of useful skills that when combined, make you truly one of a kind.
11. Happiness Factors
    - To be an efficient learner, you need to enjoy what you’re doing to learning.
    - What are the things that make you happy in your life?
    - Create monitor factors and monitor them.
12. Productivity time
    - What is your most productivity time? Morning ? Night ?
    - Every person is different and your job is to figure out what your productivity times are.
12. Self learning paradigm
    1. The core of self learning, is this idea of personal autonomy to become a self learner and efficient learner.
    2. This is a choice you have to make, based on your mainly motivation.
