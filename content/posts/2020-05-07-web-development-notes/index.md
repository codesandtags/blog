As part of my personal training I've decided to re force my knowledge in web development, so I bought one of the best courses
(in my personal opinion), [the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery 2020](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/) by [Andrei Neagoie](https://www.udemy.com/user/andrei-neagoie/) and here are my notes. 
These notes are just the most relevant parts or resources for me, so I recommend you review the course for more details.
