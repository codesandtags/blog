How is operational reuse addressed?\n\n---\n\n## Chapter 17: Microservices Architecture\n\nWhy is the bounded context concept so critical for microservices architecture?\n\n🤓 ...\n\nWhat are three ways of determining if you have the right level of granularity in a microservice?\n\n🤓 ...\n\nWhat functionality might be contained within a sidecar?\n\n🤓 ...\n\nWhat is the difference between orchestration and choreography? Which does microservices support?

Here are some of the topics covered in this book and I want to answer the self-assessment questions for each chapter.\n\n---\n\n## Chapter 1: Introduction\n\n1. **What are the four dimensions that define software architecture?**\n\n![four dimensions software architecture](images/books/software-architecture-four-dimensions.png)\n\n- **Architecture characteristics**: Define the success criteria of a system, which is generally orthogonal to the functionality of the system. Notice that all of the characteristics listed do not require knowledge of the functionality of the system, yet they are required in order for the system to function properly.\n- **Architecture Decisions**: Define the rules for how a system should be constructed. For example, an architect might make an architecture decision that only the business and services layers within a layered architecture can access the database.\n- **Structure**: Refers to the type of architecture style (or styles) the system is implemented in (such as microservices, layered, or microkernel)\n- Design principles: Define a guideline of principles rather than a hard-and-fast rule.\n\n2. **What is the difference between an architecture decision and a design principle?**\n\n- Architecture decisions form the constraints of the system and direct the development teams on what is and what isn’t allowed.\n- Design principles are guidelines that help development teams make decisions about how to implement the system.\n\n3. **List the eight core expectations of a software architect**\n\n🤓 The eight core expectations of a software architect are:\n\n- Make architecture decisions\n- Continually analyze the architecture\n- Keep current with latest trends\n- Ensure compliance with decisions\n- Diverse exposure and experience\n- Have business domain knowledge\n- Possess interpersonal skills\n- Understand and navigate politics\n\n4. **What is the First Law of Software Architecture?**\n\n> Everything in software architecture is a trade-off. -- First Law of Software Architecture\n\n> Why is more important than how. -- Second Law of Software Architecture\n\n---\n\n## Chapter 2: Architectural Thinking\n\n1. **Describe the traditional approach of architecture versus development and explain why that approach no longer works.**\n\n![Traditional approach architecture vs design](images/books/software-architecture-traditional-approach.png)\n\n🤓 The traditional approach implies that architecture is something that is fully defined up front and then merely implemented by developers. However, this approach has been found to have several major drawbacks:\n\n- **Lack of Flexibility**: Once the architecture is defined, it can be very difficult to change. However, software development is often a highly unpredictable process, and changes in requirements or technologies may necessitate changes in the architecture.\n\n- **Communication Breakdown**: Because architects and developers often work in isolation from each other, there can be a lack of understanding and communication between the two groups. Architects may make decisions without fully understanding the implementation implications, and developers may struggle to implement an architecture they had no part in designing.\n\n- **Reality Gap**: Architectural designs often look good on paper but may not work as well when actually implemented. This gap between design and reality can lead to problems and delays.\n\n2. **List the three levels of knowledge in the knowledge triangle and provide an example of each.**\n\n![Knowledge representation](images/books/software-architecture-knowledge-representation.png)\n\n🤓 Our knowledge pyramid illustrates how fundamentally different the role of architect compares to developer. Developers spend their whole careers honing expertise, and transitioning to the architect role means a shift in that perspective, which many individuals find difficult. The architect role requires a different set of skills, and the knowledge pyramid illustrates this shift.\n\n3. **Why is it more important for an architect to focus on technical breadth rather than technical depth?**\n\n🤓 Focusing on technical breadth means acquiring a wide-ranging understanding of various technologies, patterns, languages, platforms, and principles. This breadth allows architects to:\n\n- **See the Big Picture**: Understand how different components and technologies fit together and influence each other. This is essential when designing complex systems where decisions in one area can significantly impact other areas.\n\n- **Make Informed Decisions**: Choose the most suitable technologies and designs for the system's requirements. A broad knowledge allows architects to consider a wider range of options and make more informed decisions.\n\n- **Communicate Effectively**: Communicate with different stakeholders, including developers, project managers, business stakeholders, and others. Each group may have different areas of expertise and concerns, and a broad understanding helps architects bridge these gaps.\n\n- **Adapt to Change**: Stay adaptable and resilient in the face of changing requirements, technologies, and business environments. A wide knowledge base allows architects to learn and adopt new technologies more easily.\n\nFor example, as an architect, it is more beneficial to know that five solutions exist for a particular problem than to have singular expertise in only one.\n\n4. **What are some of the ways of maintaining your technical depth and remaining hands-on as an architect?**\n\n- 🤓 **Coding**: Try to spend some of your time coding. This could be writing prototypes, creating proofs of concept, fixing bugs, or contributing to critical parts of the system. This not only helps maintain your coding skills but also gives you firsthand experience with the technologies you're using.\n\n- **Education**: Continually educate yourself about new technologies, languages, and methodologies. This can involve reading books, articles, or research papers, attending conferences or webinars, or taking online courses.\n\n- **Personal Projects**: Work on personal projects outside of your day-to-day work. This can be a great way to learn new technologies, experiment with different architectures, or just keep your coding skills sharp.\n\n- **Code Reviews**: Participate in code reviews. This gives you a chance to see how the architecture is being implemented, spot potential issues, and provide valuable feedback to developers.\n\n- **Pair Programming**: Occasionally pair program with developers. This is another great way to stay familiar with the codebase and the challenges that developers face.\n\n- **Prototyping**: When considering a new technology or architectural approach, create a small prototype. This can provide valuable insights that you wouldn't get from reading about it alone.\n\n- **Stay Connected with the Developer Community**: Participate in tech meetups, online forums, open-source projects, and other communities. This can keep you updated on new technologies and best practices, and provide opportunities to learn from others.\n\nBy staying hands-on and maintaining technical depth, you'll be a more effective architect. You'll understand the challenges that developers face, make better architectural decisions, and be able to communicate more effectively with your team.\n\n---\n\n## Chapter 3 - Modularity\n\n1. What is meant by the term connascence?\n\n🤓 **Connascence** is a metric used to describe the coupling or the degree of interdependence between two or more parts of a software system.\n\n2. What is the difference between static and dynamic connascence?\n\n🤓 **Static connascence** is coupling that can be determined by examining the source code, while **dynamic connascence** is coupling that can only be determined when the code is running.\n\n3. What does connascence of type mean? Is it static or dynamic connascence?\n\n🤓 **Connascence of type** is when multiple parts of a program must agree on the type of an entity. It is a form of static connascence.\n\n4. What is the strongest form of connascence?\n\n🤓 **Connascence of Identity** is the strongest form of connascence. It refers to when multiple parts of the system depend on a mutable entity's identity.\n\n5. What is the weakest form of connascence?\n\n🤓 **Connascence of Name**, where multiple parts of the system must agree on the name of an entity, is considered the weakest form of connascence.\n\n6. Which is preferred within a code base—static or dynamic connascence?\n\n🤓 **Static connascence** is generally preferred within a code base as it is easier to identify and manage than dynamic connascence.\n\n---\n\n## Chapter 4 - Modularity\n\n![Architecture Characteristics](images/books/software-architecture-characteristics.png)\n\n**1. What three criteria must an attribute meet to be considered an architecture characteristic?**\n\n🤓 An attribute must be testable, contribute to the architecture of the system, and provide a way to measure and quantify it.\n\n**2. What is the difference between an implicit characteristic and an explicit one? Provide an example of each.**\n\n![Architecture Characteristics](images/books/software-architecture-explicit-implicit-characteristics.png)\n\n🤓 An implicit characteristic is one that is required or assumed but not explicitly stated, like usability. An explicit characteristic is one that is directly stated and designed for, such as response time.\n\n**3. Provide an example of an operational characteristic**\n\n🤓 An example of an operational characteristic is availability, which refers to the system's ability to be in a state to perform its designated function during operation.\n\n**4. Provide an example of a structural characteristic.**\n\n🤓 An example of a structural characteristic is modularity, referring to the degree to which a system's components may be separated and recombined.\n\n**5. Provide an example of a cross-cutting characteristic.**\n\n🤓 An example of a cross-cutting characteristic is security, which is the system's ability to resist unauthorized attempts at usage or behavior modification, affecting multiple components of the system.\n\n**6. Which architecture characteristic is more important to strive for—availability or performance?**\n\n🤓 The importance of availability versus performance **depends on the specific needs of the system being developed**. For a critical system where downtime could be costly, availability may be more important. For a system where speed is crucial for user satisfaction, performance may be more important. The context and requirements of the system dictate which characteristic is more important to strive for.\n","source":"_posts/en/fundamentals-of-software-architecture-part-1.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Fundamentals of Software Architecture Book - Part 1\ndate: 2023-07-17 18:50:03\ntags: [software-architecture, books]\ncategory: Software Architecture\nthumbnail: images/books/cover-fundamentals-software-architecture.png\nexcerpt: Here I have the relevant points to me of the book Fundamentals of Software Architecture by Mark Richards and Neal Ford.

Here are some of the topics covered in this book and I want to answer the self-assessment questions for each chapter.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-1:-introduction\">Chapter 1: Introduction<a title=\"#chapter-1:-introduction\" href=\"#chapter-1:-introduction\"></a></h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>What are the four dimensions that define software architecture?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"images/books/software-architecture-four-dimensions.png\" alt=\"four dimensions software architecture\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"φbp\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Architecture characteristics</strong>: Define the success criteria of a system, which is generally orthogonal to the functionality of the system. Notice that all of the characteristics listed do not require knowledge of the functionality of the system, yet they are required in order for the system to function properly.</li>\n<li><strong>Architecture Decisions</strong>: Define the rules for how a system should be constructed. For example, an architect might make an architecture decision that only the business and services layers within a layered architecture can access the database.</li>\n<li><strong>Structure</strong>: Refers to the type of architecture style (or styles) the system is implemented in (such as microservices, layered, or microkernel)</li>\n<li>Design principles: Define a guideline of principles rather than a hard-and-fast rule.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>What is the difference between an architecture decision and a design principle?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Architecture decisions form the constraints of the system and direct the development teams on what is and what isn’t allowed.</li>\n<li>Design principles are guidelines that help development teams make decisions about how to implement the system.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>List the eight core expectations of a software architect</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>🤓 The eight core expectations of a software architect are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make architecture decisions</li>\n<li>Continually analyze the architecture</li>\n<li>Keep current with latest trends</li>\n<li>Ensure compliance with decisions</li>\n<li>Diverse exposure and experience</li>\n<li>Have business domain knowledge</li>\n<li>Possess interpersonal skills</li>\n<li>Understand and navigate politics</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>What is the First Law of Software Architecture?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Everything in software architecture is a trade-off. – First Law of Software Architecture</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Why is more important than how. – Second Law of Software Architecture</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-2:-architectural-thinking\">Chapter 2: Architectural Thinking<a title=\"#chapter-2:-architectural-thinking\" href=\"#chapter-2:-architectural-thinking\"></a></h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Describe the traditional approach of architecture versus development and explain why that approach no longer works.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"images/books/software-architecture-traditional-approach.png\" alt=\"Traditional approach architecture vs design\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"φbp\"></p>\n<p>🤓 The traditional approach implies that architecture is something that is fully defined up front and then merely implemented by developers. However, this approach has been found to have several major drawbacks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Lack of Flexibility</strong>: Once the architecture is defined, it can be very difficult to change. However, software development is often a highly unpredictable process, and changes in requirements or technologies may necessitate changes in the architecture.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Communication Breakdown</strong>: Because architects and developers often work in isolation from each other, there can be a lack of understanding and communication between the two groups. Architects may make decisions without fully understanding the implementation implications, and developers may struggle to implement an architecture they had no part in designing.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Reality Gap</strong>: Architectural designs often look good on paper but may not work as well when actually implemented. This gap between design and reality can lead to problems and delays.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>List the three levels of knowledge in the knowledge triangle and provide an example of each.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"images/books/software-architecture-knowledge-representation.png\" alt=\"Knowledge representation\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"φbp\"></p>\n<p>🤓 Our knowledge pyramid illustrates how fundamentally different the role of architect compares to developer. Developers spend their whole careers honing expertise, and transitioning to the architect role means a shift in that perspective, which many individuals find difficult. The architect role requires a different set of skills, and the knowledge pyramid illustrates this shift.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Why is it more important for an architect to focus on technical breadth rather than technical depth?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>🤓 Focusing on technical breadth means acquiring a wide-ranging understanding of various technologies, patterns, languages, platforms, and principles. This breadth allows architects to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>See the Big Picture</strong>: Understand how different components and technologies fit together and influence each other. This is essential when designing complex systems where decisions in one area can significantly impact other areas.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Make Informed Decisions</strong>: Choose the most suitable technologies and designs for the system’s requirements. A broad knowledge allows architects to consider a wider range of options and make more informed decisions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Communicate Effectively</strong>: Communicate with different stakeholders, including developers, project managers, business stakeholders, and others. Each group may have different areas of expertise and concerns, and a broad understanding helps architects bridge these gaps.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Adapt to Change</strong>: Stay adaptable and resilient in the face of changing requirements, technologies, and business environments. A wide knowledge base allows architects to learn and adopt new technologies more easily.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example, as an architect, it is more beneficial to know that five solutions exist for a particular problem than to have singular expertise in only one.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>What are some of the ways of maintaining your technical depth and remaining hands-on as an architect?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>🤓 <strong>Coding</strong>: Try to spend some of your time coding. This could be writing prototypes, creating proofs of concept, fixing bugs, or contributing to critical parts of the system. This not only helps maintain your coding skills but also gives you firsthand experience with the technologies you’re using.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Education</strong>: Continually educate yourself about new technologies, languages, and methodologies. This can involve reading books, articles, or research papers, attending conferences or webinars, or taking online courses.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Personal Projects</strong>: Work on personal projects outside of your day-to-day work. This can be a great way to learn new technologies, experiment with different architectures, or just keep your coding skills sharp.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Code Reviews</strong>: Participate in code reviews. This gives you a chance to see how the architecture is being implemented, spot potential issues, and provide valuable feedback to developers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Pair Programming</strong>: Occasionally pair program with developers. This is another great way to stay familiar with the codebase and the challenges that developers face.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Prototyping</strong>: When considering a new technology or architectural approach, create a small prototype. This can provide valuable insights that you wouldn’t get from reading about it alone.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Stay Connected with the Developer Community</strong>: Participate in tech meetups, online forums, open-source projects, and other communities. This can keep you updated on new technologies and best practices, and provide opportunities to learn from others.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By staying hands-on and maintaining technical depth, you’ll be a more effective architect. You’ll understand the challenges that developers face, make better architectural decisions, and be able to communicate more effectively with your team.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-3---modularity\">Chapter 3 - Modularity<a title=\"#chapter-3---modularity\" href=\"#chapter-3---modularity\"></a></h2>\n<ol>\n<li>What is meant by the term connascence?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>🤓 <strong>Connascence</strong> is a metric used to describe the coupling or the degree of interdependence between two or more parts of a software system.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>What is the difference between static and dynamic connascence?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>🤓 <strong>Static connascence</strong> is coupling that can be determined by examining the source code, while <strong>dynamic connascence</strong> is coupling that can only be determined when the code is running.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>What does connascence of type mean?

This part is focused on Architecture characteristics and fitness functions.\n\n---\n\n## Chapter 5: Identifying Architecture Characteristics\n\n1. **Give a reason why it is a good practice to limit the number of characteristics (“-ilities”) an architecture should support.**\n\n🤓 It's good practice to limit the number of \"-ilities\" because each characteristic can introduce complexity into the architecture, potentially affecting its performance, maintainability, and other aspects. Moreover, some characteristics can conflict with others, making it a balancing act to satisfy all needs. Focusing on the most critical characteristics ensures a lean and effective architecture.\n\n2. **True or false: most architecture characteristics come from business requirements and user stories.**\n\n🤓 **False**. While business requirements and user stories do influence the architecture characteristics, they are not the sole sources. Architecture characteristics are often also derived from technical constraints, non-functional requirements, or the strategic direction of the organization.\n\n3. **If a business stakeholder states that time-to-market (i.e., getting new features and bug fixes pushed out to users as fast as possible) is the most important business concern, which architecture characteristics would the architecture need to support?**\n\n![Architectural Characteristics Table](images/books/software-architecture-characteristics-table.png)\n\n🤓 The architecture would need to support characteristics such as\n\n- **Agility** (for ease of implementing new features and fixing bugs)\n- **Deployability** (for fast and efficient deployment processes)\n- **Testability** (to quickly verify new features and bug fixes).\n\n4. **What is the difference between scalability and elasticity?**\n\n🤓 **Scalability** is the ability of a system to handle increased load by adding more resources or using existing resources more efficiently. **Elasticity**, on the other hand, is the ability of a system to dynamically scale up and down based on the demand, often realized through cloud-based infrastructures.\n\n5. **You find out that your company is about to undergo several major acquisitions to significantly increase its customer base. Which architectural characteristics should you be worried about?**\n\n🤓 The significant increase in the customer base would mean you should be particularly concerned about :\n\n- **Scalability** (to handle the increased load)\n- **Performance** (to ensure system responsiveness under increased load)\n- **Interoperability** (if the acquisitions involve integrating with other systems).\n\n---\n\n## Chapter 6: Measuring and Governing Architecture Characteristics\n\n1. **Why is cyclomatic complexity such an important metric to analyze for architecture?**\n\n🤓 **Cyclomatic complexity is a measure of the number of linearly independent paths through a program's source code**, essentially assessing its complexity. High cyclomatic complexity often indicates that a system might be hard to maintain, understand, and modify. Thus, it can serve as an early warning signal for potential architectural problems, encouraging refactoring or redesign to ensure simplicity and maintainability.\n\n2. **What is an architecture fitness function? How can they be used to analyze an architecture?**\n\n🤓 An architecture fitness function is a way to quantitatively measure an architectural characteristic to determine how well the architecture aligns with the intended design principles. They serve as a guide to developers by enforcing architectural constraints and driving architectural decisions. Fitness functions can be used to continually assess and validate that the evolving architecture remains fit for its purpose throughout its lifecycle.\n\n3. **Provide an example of an architecture fitness function to measure the scalability of an architecture.**\n\n🤓 An example of a fitness function for scalability could be the response time of the system as load increases. You could simulate a certain number of users (for instance, 10,000 users) hitting your system simultaneously, and measure the response time. If the response time stays within acceptable boundaries, your system can be considered scalable to that extent.\n\n4. **What is the most important criteria for an architecture characteristic to allow architects and developers to create fitness functions?**\n\n🤓 The most important criteria for an architecture characteristic is that it must be **quantifiable** and **measurable**. Fitness functions are objective metrics, so the architectural characteristic they are measuring must be translated into something that can be measured consistently and accurately. **If a characteristic can't be measured, it can't be tracked or evaluated through a fitness function**.\n\n---\n\n## Chapter 7: Scope of Architecture Characteristics\n\n1. **What is an architectural quantum, and why is it important to architecture?**\n\n🤓 An architectural quantum is the smallest independent, deployable unit in an architecture. The quantum often corresponds to a microservice in a microservices architecture. The concept is important because it helps architects design systems that are modular, loosely coupled, and can evolve independently.\n\n2. **Assume a system consisting of a single user interface with four independently deployed services, each containing its own separate database. Would this system have a single quantum or four quanta? Why?**\n\n🤓 This system would have four quanta. Each of the four services is independently deployable and contains its own database, thus each service is an architectural quantum.\n\n3. **Assume a system with an administration portion managing static reference data (such as the product catalog, and warehouse information) and a customer-facing portion managing the placement of orders. How many quanta should this system be and why? If you envision multiple quanta, could the admin quantum and customer-facing quantum share a database? If so, in which quantum would the database need to reside?**\n\n🤓 This system would most likely have two quanta - one for the administration portion and one for the customer-facing portion. Each has distinct responsibilities and could evolve independently. While the two quanta could technically share a database, it would be better for each to have its own to maintain the principle of independent deployability. Sharing a database would introduce a level of coupling that could inhibit the ability to deploy and scale each quantum independently. If they were to share a database, it would reside in neither quantum specifically, but would become a shared resource, which would need to be carefully managed to avoid conflicts and ensure consistency.\n\n---\n\n## Chapter 8: Component-Based Thinking\n\n1. **We define the term component as a building block of an application—something the application does. A component usually consist of a group of classes or source files. How are components typically manifested within an application or service?**\n\n![Architectural Characteristics Table](images/books/software-architecture-component-levels.png)\n\n🤓 Components are usually manifested within an application or service as distinct units of functionality. They can be organized as modules, packages, or services, each encapsulating a set of related functionalities. In object-oriented languages, a component can comprise multiple classes, interfaces, or packages. In a microservices architecture, each microservice can be considered a component.\n\n1. **What is the difference between technical partitioning and domain partitioning? Provide an example of each.**\n\n![Architectural Characteristics Table](images/books/software-architecture-technical-and-domain-partioning.png)\n\n🤓 **Technical partitioning** organizes components based on their technical role (like UI, business logic, data access), while **domain partitioning** organizes components based on business functionality or domain concepts. An example of technical partitioning could be a **three-tier architecture with separate layers** for presentation, business logic, and data storage. An example of domain partitioning **could be a microservices architecture** where each service corresponds to a specific business capability, like customer management or order processing.\n\n1. **What is the advantage of domain partitioning?**\n\n🤓 **Domain partitioning** aligns the software system with the business domain, making the system easier to understand and modify according to business changes. It facilitates independent development and deployment of different business capabilities, which can improve **speed, scalability, and resilience**.\n\n4. **Under what circumstances would technical partitioning be a better choice over domain partitioning?**\n\n🤓 Technical partitioning might be a better choice when building simple or monolithic applications where business functionality is not complex or diversified enough to justify the overhead of domain partitioning. It might also be preferred when the team's technical expertise significantly outweighs their understanding of the business domain.\n\n5. **What is the entity trap? Why is it not a good approach for component identification?**\n\n🤓 The entity trap is a common mistake made when identifying components based on entities in the business domain, **which often leads to anemic domain models with components that lack meaningful behavior**. This approach is problematic because it encourages a data-centric view of the system rather than focusing on the behavior and responsibilities of components, which can lead to poor encapsulation and high coupling.\n\n6. **When might you choose the workflow approach over the Actor/Actions approach when identifying core components?**\n\n🤓 The **workflow approach** might be preferred when the system's primary purpose is to facilitate a complex series of steps or transactions, where the sequence and interaction of operations are critical. On the other hand, the **Actor/Actions** approach could be better when the system is more centered around user interactions or when you have distinct user roles performing different actions on the system. The best choice depends on the specific context and requirements of the system.\n","source":"_posts/en/fundamentals-of-software-architecture-part-2.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Fundamentals of Software Architecture Book - Part 2\nauthor: codesandtags\ndate: 2023-07-21 18:43:27\ncategory: Software Architecture\nthumbnail: images/books/cover-fundamentals-software-architecture.png\ntags: [software-architecture, books]\nexcerpt: Here I have the relevant points to me of the book Fundamentals of Software Architecture by Mark Richards and Neal Ford.

An example of domain partitioning **could be a microservices architecture** where each service corresponds to a specific business capability, like customer management or order processing.\n\n1. **What is the advantage of domain partitioning?**\n\n🤓 **Domain partitioning** aligns the software system with the business domain, making the system easier to understand and modify according to business changes. It facilitates independent development and deployment of different business capabilities, which can improve **speed, scalability, and resilience**.\n\n4. **Under what circumstances would technical partitioning be a better choice over domain partitioning?**\n\n🤓 Technical partitioning might be a better choice when building simple or monolithic applications where business functionality is not complex or diversified enough to justify the overhead of domain partitioning. It might also be preferred when the team's technical expertise significantly outweighs their understanding of the business domain.\n\n5. **What is the entity trap? Why is it not a good approach for component identification?**\n\n🤓 The entity trap is a common mistake made when identifying components based on entities in the business domain, **which often leads to anemic domain models with components that lack meaningful behavior**. This approach is problematic because it encourages a data-centric view of the system rather than focusing on the behavior and responsibilities of components, which can lead to poor encapsulation and high coupling.\n\n6. **When might you choose the workflow approach over the Actor/Actions approach when identifying core components?**\n\n🤓 The **workflow approach** might be preferred when the system's primary purpose is to facilitate a complex series of steps or transactions, where the sequence and interaction of operations are critical. On the other hand, the **Actor/Actions** approach could be better when the system is more centered around user interactions or when you have distinct user roles performing different actions on the system. The best choice depends on the specific context and requirements of the system.\n","slug":"en/fundamentals-of-software-architecture-part-2","published":1,"updated":"2023-07-23T20:41:47.673Z","_id":"clkd2f8pi0007ist2askb8yhd","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"2023/07/21/en/fundamentals-of-software-architecture-part-2","content":"<h2 id=\"fundamentals-of-software-architecture\">Fundamentals of Software Architecture<a title=\"#fundamentals-of-software-architecture\" href=\"#fundamentals-of-software-architecture\"></a></h2>\n<h3 id=\"book-details\">Book Details<a title=\"#book-details\" href=\"#book-details\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>📖 <strong>Title</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/fundamentals-of-software/9781492043447/\" target=\"_blank\">Fundamentals of Software Architecture</a></li>\n<li>✍️ <strong>Author</strong>: Mark Richards, Neal Ford</li>\n<li>📆 <strong>Publication Year</strong>: 2020</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"summary\">Summary<a title=\"#summary\" href=\"#summary\"></a></h3>\n<p>Here I have the relevant points to me of the book Fundamentals of Software Architecture by Mark Richards and Neal Ford.

Sharing a database would introduce a level of coupling that could inhibit the ability to deploy and scale each quantum independently.

Here are some tips and strategies for preparing for behavioral questions:\n\n## Understand the purpose\n\nBehavioral questions are designed to evaluate your soft skills, such as teamwork, communication, leadership, adaptability, and conflict resolution. Recognize that interviewers are looking for specific examples from your past experiences to gauge your potential for success in the role.\n\n## Use the STAR method\n\nThe STAR method is a widely used technique for answering behavioral interview questions. It helps structure your response by focusing on a specific example from your past experiences and demonstrating your skills and abilities in a clear, concise manner. The acronym STAR stands for:\n\n**Situation**: Begin by describing the context or background of the situation you faced. Provide enough detail to help the interviewer understand the circumstances, but be concise. This sets the stage for the rest of your answer and helps the interviewer visualize the scenario.\n\n**Example: **\n\n> \"In my previous role as a software developer, I was working on a project with a tight deadline, and one of my team members fell ill, leaving us short-staffed.\"\n\n**Task**: Explain the specific task or goal you needed to accomplish in that situation. This part highlights your responsibility and the challenge you faced.\n\n**Example: **\n\n> \"As the team lead, my task was to ensure we met the deadline without compromising the quality of the project, while also managing the increased workload due to my colleague's absence.\"\n\n**Action**: Describe the specific actions you took to address the task or challenge. Focus on your role and the steps you took, showcasing your skills, abilities, and decision-making process.\n\n**Example: **\n\n> \"I assessed the remaining tasks and prioritized them based on importance and time sensitivity. I then redistributed the workload among the team members, making sure to assign tasks based on individual strengths and availability. I also communicated the situation to our manager and requested additional resources. To keep the team motivated, I held daily check-ins to monitor progress and address any concerns.\"\n\n**Result**: Explain the outcome of your actions, emphasizing the positive impact you had on the situation. Quantify your results whenever possible to demonstrate the tangible benefits of your actions.\n\n**Example:**\n\n> \"As a result, we were able to complete the project on time and within budget, despite being short-staffed. Our manager praised the team for our effective communication and adaptability, and our client was satisfied with the quality of the final product.\"\n\nBy following the STAR method when answering behavioral questions, you can ensure that your response is well-structured, focused, and clearly demonstrates your skills and abilities. This technique helps you showcase your problem-solving and decision-making skills, making it easier for the interviewer to assess your fit for the role.\n\n## Research common behavioral questions\n\nFamiliarize yourself with common behavioral questions, such as:\n\n- Tell me about a time when you faced a difficult problem. How did you handle it?\n- Describe a situation where you had to collaborate with a difficult colleague.\n- Can you provide an example of when you had to lead a team or project? What challenges did - you face, and how did you overcome them?\n- How do you handle stressful situations or tight deadlines?\n- Prepare specific examples: Reflect on your past experiences (professional, academic, or personal) and identify situations that demonstrate your soft skills. Prepare detailed examples for each situation that follow the STAR method.\n\n## Practice your delivery\n\nRehearse your answers out loud to ensure your responses are clear, concise, and well-structured. Consider practicing with a friend, family member, or mentor who can provide feedback and ask follow-up questions.\n\n## Tailor your answers to the company and role\n\nResearch the company's values, culture, and expectations for the role you're interviewing for, and tailor your answers to align with their priorities. This demonstrates your understanding of the company and showcases your fit within the organization.\n\n## Be honest and authentic\n\nWhile it's essential to present yourself in the best light, avoid exaggerating or fabricating your experiences. Interviewers can often tell when a candidate is not being genuine, which could harm your credibility.\n\n## Show self-awareness and growth\n\nWhen discussing challenging situations or mistakes, emphasize what you learned from the experience and how you've grown as a result. This shows your ability to learn from your mistakes and adapt in the future.\n\nBy practicing behavioral questions using these strategies, you'll be better prepared to demonstrate your soft skills and showcase your fit within the company during the interview process.\n\n![space](images/behavioral-questions.jpg)\n","source":"_posts/en/how-to-succeed-behavioral-questions.md","raw":"---\ntitle: How to succeed behavioral questions?\ndate: 2023-03-26 22:53:52\ntags: [interview]\nexcerpt: Practicing behavioral questions is essential for interview preparation because they allow the interviewer to assess your interpersonal and problem-solving skills, work ethic, and cultural fit with the company.\nauthor: codesandtags\ncategory: FAANG\nthumbnail: images/faang-thumbnail.jpg\n---\n\nPracticing behavioral questions is essential for interview preparation because they allow the interviewer to assess your interpersonal and problem-solving skills, work ethic, and cultural fit with the company.

This sets the stage for the rest of your answer and helps the interviewer visualize the scenario.\n\n**Example: **\n\n> \"In my previous role as a software developer, I was working on a project with a tight deadline, and one of my team members fell ill, leaving us short-staffed.\"\n\n**Task**: Explain the specific task or goal you needed to accomplish in that situation. This part highlights your responsibility and the challenge you faced.\n\n**Example: **\n\n> \"As the team lead, my task was to ensure we met the deadline without compromising the quality of the project, while also managing the increased workload due to my colleague's absence.\"\n\n**Action**: Describe the specific actions you took to address the task or challenge. Focus on your role and the steps you took, showcasing your skills, abilities, and decision-making process.\n\n**Example: **\n\n> \"I assessed the remaining tasks and prioritized them based on importance and time sensitivity. I then redistributed the workload among the team members, making sure to assign tasks based on individual strengths and availability. I also communicated the situation to our manager and requested additional resources. To keep the team motivated, I held daily check-ins to monitor progress and address any concerns.\"\n\n**Result**: Explain the outcome of your actions, emphasizing the positive impact you had on the situation. Quantify your results whenever possible to demonstrate the tangible benefits of your actions.\n\n**Example:**\n\n> \"As a result, we were able to complete the project on time and within budget, despite being short-staffed. Our manager praised the team for our effective communication and adaptability, and our client was satisfied with the quality of the final product.\"\n\nBy following the STAR method when answering behavioral questions, you can ensure that your response is well-structured, focused, and clearly demonstrates your skills and abilities. This technique helps you showcase your problem-solving and decision-making skills, making it easier for the interviewer to assess your fit for the role.\n\n## Research common behavioral questions\n\nFamiliarize yourself with common behavioral questions, such as:\n\n- Tell me about a time when you faced a difficult problem. How did you handle it?\n- Describe a situation where you had to collaborate with a difficult colleague.\n- Can you provide an example of when you had to lead a team or project? What challenges did - you face, and how did you overcome them?\n- How do you handle stressful situations or tight deadlines?\n- Prepare specific examples: Reflect on your past experiences (professional, academic, or personal) and identify situations that demonstrate your soft skills. Prepare detailed examples for each situation that follow the STAR method.\n\n## Practice your delivery\n\nRehearse your answers out loud to ensure your responses are clear, concise, and well-structured. Consider practicing with a friend, family member, or mentor who can provide feedback and ask follow-up questions.\n\n## Tailor your answers to the company and role\n\nResearch the company's values, culture, and expectations for the role you're interviewing for, and tailor your answers to align with their priorities. This demonstrates your understanding of the company and showcases your fit within the organization.\n\n## Be honest and authentic\n\nWhile it's essential to present yourself in the best light, avoid exaggerating or fabricating your experiences. Interviewers can often tell when a candidate is not being genuine, which could harm your credibility.\n\n## Show self-awareness and growth\n\nWhen discussing challenging situations or mistakes, emphasize what you learned from the experience and how you've grown as a result. This shows your ability to learn from your mistakes and adapt in the future.\n\nBy practicing behavioral questions using these strategies, you'll be better prepared to demonstrate your soft skills and showcase your fit within the company during the interview process.\n\n![space](images/behavioral-questions.jpg)\n","slug":"en/how-to-succeed-behavioral-questions","published":1,"updated":"2023-07-17T22:47:10.536Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"2023/03/26/en/how-to-succeed-behavioral-questions","_id":"clkd2f8pl000aist28lsaglz4","content":"<p>Practicing behavioral questions is essential for interview preparation because they allow the interviewer to assess your interpersonal and problem-solving skills, work ethic, and cultural fit with the company.

An open layer means that as a request moves top-down through the layers, it can move to any layer below it.\n\n2. **Describe the layers of isolation concept and what the benefits are of this concept.**\n\n🤓 The layers of isolation concept means that changes made in one layer of the architecture generally don't impact or affect components in other layers. This concept is important because it allows for the architecture to be more flexible and agile. The benefit is that any layer in the architecture can be changed without impacting other layers.\n\n3. **What is the architecture sinkhole anti-pattern?**\n\n🤓 This anti-pattern occurs when requests move from layer to layer as a simple pass-through. This is a problem because it means that the architecture is not providing any value.\n\n4. **What are some of the main architecture characteristics that would drive you to use a layered architecture?**\n\n🤓 Simplicity, Overall Cost, and Reliability are some of the main architecture characteristics that would drive you to use a layered architecture. It's also a good architecture style to use when you have a small team of developers or very tight budget.\n\n5. **Why isn’t testability well supported in the layered architecture style?**\n\n🤓 Most developers are not going to spend hours executing the entire regression test suite every time they make a change to a single layer, particularly along with dozens of other changes being made to the monolithic applicationi at the same time.\n\n6. **Why isn’t agility well supported in the layered architecture style?**\n\n🤓 Given the monolitic approach of the layered architecture style, it's not easy to make changes to the architecture quickly.\n\n---\n\n## Chapter 11: Pipeline Architecture\n\n### Pipeline Architecture Rating\n\n<img src=\"images/books/software-pipeline-architecture-rating.png\" alt=\"Layered Architecture Rating\" width=\"60%\"/>\n\n1. **Can pipes be bidirectional in a pipeline architecture?**\n\n🤓 No, pipes are unidirectional.\n\n2. **Name the four types of filters and their purpose.**\n\n- **Producer**: The starting point of a process, outbound only, sometimes called the source.\n\n**Transformer**: Accepts input, optionally performs a transformation on some or all of the data, then forwards it to the outbound pipe. Functional advocates will recognize this feature as map.\n\n- **Tester**: Accepts input, tests one or more criteria, then optionally produces output, based on the test. Functional programmers will recognize this as similar to reduce.\n\n- **Consumer**: The termination point for the pipeline flow. Consumers sometimes persist the final result of the pipeline process to a database, or they may display the final results on a user interface screen.\n\n3. **Can a filter send data out through multiple pipes?**\n\n🤓 Filters are self-contained, independent from other filters. Filters should perform one task only. Composite tasks should be handled by a sequence of filters rather than a single one.\n\n4. **Is the pipeline architecture style technically partitioned or domain partitioned?**\n\n🤓 Pipeline architecture is technically partitioned.\n\n5. **In what way does the pipeline architecture support modularity?**\n\n🤓 Pipeline Architecture supports modularity by allowing you to add or remove filters without impacting the rest of the pipeline.\n\n6. **Provide two examples of the pipeline architecture style.**\n\n- Unix pipes and the Java 8 Streams API.\n- Apache Kafka Streams\n- ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes\n\n---\n\n## Chapter 12: Microkernel Architecture\n\n### Microkernel Architecture Rating\n\n<img src=\"images/books/software-microkernel-architecture-rating.png\" alt=\"Layered Architecture Rating\" width=\"60%\"/>\n\n1. **What is another name for the microkernel architecture style?**\n\n🤓 ...\n\n2. **Under what situations is it OK for plug-in components to be dependent on other plug-in components?**\n\n🤓 ...\n\n3. **What are some of the tools and frameworks that can be used to manage plug-ins?**\n\n🤓 ...\n\n4. **What would you do if you had a third-party plug-in that didn’t conform to the standard plug-in contract in the core system?**\n\n🤓 ...\n\n5. **Provide two examples of the microkernel architecture style.**\n\n🤓 ...\n\n6. **Is the microkernel architecture style technically partitioned or domain partitioned?**\n\n🤓 ...\n\n7. **Why is the microkernel architecture always a single architecture quantum?**\n\n🤓 ...\n\n8. **What is domain/architecture isomorphism?**\n\n🤓 ...\n\n---\n","source":"_posts/en/fundamentals-of-software-architecture-part-3.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Fundamentals of Software Architecture Book - Part 3\nauthor: codesandtags\ndate: 2023-08-02 18:43:27\ncategory: Software Architecture\nthumbnail: images/books/cover-fundamentals-software-architecture.png\ntags: [software-architecture, books]\nexcerpt: Here I have the relevant points to me of the book Fundamentals of Software Architecture by Mark Richards and Neal Ford.

An open layer means that as a request moves top-down through the layers, it can move to any layer below it.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Describe the layers of isolation concept and what the benefits are of this concept.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>🤓 The layers of isolation concept means that changes made in one layer of the architecture generally don’t impact or affect components in other layers. This concept is important because it allows for the architecture to be more flexible and agile. The benefit is that any layer in the architecture can be changed without impacting other layers.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>What is the architecture sinkhole anti-pattern?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>🤓 This anti-pattern occurs when requests move from layer to layer as a simple pass-through. This is a problem because it means that the architecture is not providing any value.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>What are some of the main architecture characteristics that would drive you to use a layered architecture?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>🤓 Simplicity, Overall Cost, and Reliability are some of the main architecture characteristics that would drive you to use a layered architecture. It’s also a good architecture style to use when you have a small team of developers or very tight budget.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong>Why isn’t testability well supported in the layered architecture style?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>🤓 Most developers are not going to spend hours executing the entire regression test suite every time they make a change to a single layer, particularly along with dozens of other changes being made to the monolithic applicationi at the same time.</p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li><strong>Why isn’t agility well supported in the layered architecture style?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>🤓 Given the monolitic approach of the layered architecture style, it’s not easy to make changes to the architecture quickly.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-11:-pipeline-architecture\">Chapter 11: Pipeline Architecture<a title=\"#chapter-11:-pipeline-architecture\" href=\"#chapter-11:-pipeline-architecture\"></a></h2>\n<h3 id=\"pipeline-architecture-rating\">Pipeline Architecture Rating<a title=\"#pipeline-architecture-rating\" href=\"#pipeline-architecture-rating\"></a></h3>\n<img src=\"images/books/software-pipeline-architecture-rating.png\" alt=\"Layered Architecture Rating\" width=\"60%\"/>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Can pipes be bidirectional in a pipeline architecture?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>🤓 No, pipes are unidirectional.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Name the four types of filters and their purpose.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Producer</strong>: The starting point of a process, outbound only, sometimes called the source.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Transformer</strong>: Accepts input, optionally performs a transformation on some or all of the data, then forwards it to the outbound pipe. Functional advocates will recognize this feature as map.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Tester</strong>: Accepts input, tests one or more criteria, then optionally produces output, based on the test. Functional programmers will recognize this as similar to reduce.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Consumer</strong>: The termination point for the pipeline flow. Consumers sometimes persist the final result of the pipeline process to a database, or they may display the final results on a user interface screen.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Can a filter send data out through multiple pipes?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>🤓 Filters are self-contained, independent from other filters.
